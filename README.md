# Instagram task

The brief for this task was to remake the Instagram log-in page using **HTML** and **CSS**

#### Original Instagram page:
![Instagram login page](images/original-insta.png)

#### My remade Instagram page:
![My version of the Instagram login page](images/my-insta.png)

To get the two sections of the page to be next to each other, each element was placed in its own `Div` and styled using CSS.

A bottom navigation bar with links was added to mimick the page style.
